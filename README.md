# gmapy - examples

The intended purpose of this repository is to provide examples
of how the [gmapy](https://github.com/iaea-nds/gmapy) Python package
can be used to perform nuclear data evaluations. As `gmapy` currently
lacks comprehensive documentation and the user interface
may change, this repository has to be regarded as work in progress
and substantial updates and restructuring are expected.
